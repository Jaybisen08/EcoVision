🌿 What is EcoVision? – Detailed Description

EcoVision is an AI-powered waste analysis system designed to help individuals, students, communities, and environmental teams identify waste correctly and understand its ecological impact. It combines cutting-edge computer vision, environmental intelligence, and user-friendly design to make waste management smarter and more accessible for everyone.

♻️ Purpose

EcoVision was built to solve a growing problem:
Most people don't know what type of waste they are holding or how to dispose of it properly.
Incorrect disposal leads to:

Soil and groundwater contamination

Microplastic pollution

Toxic emissions

Higher recycling costs

Health risks

EcoVision bridges this knowledge gap using AI.

🤖 How EcoVision Works
1. Upload an Image

Users simply upload a picture of any waste item — plastic bottles, food scraps, electronics, wrappers, containers, etc.

2. AI Classification (Gemini Vision)

EcoVision sends the image to Google Gemini 2.5 Vision, which returns:

Waste category

Analysis confidence score

Notes about the waste

Disposal steps

Environmental impact distribution

3. Environmental Impact Breakdown

The app generates a visual pie chart showing four impact metrics:

🌫️ Greenhouse Emissions

🧪 Soil Contamination

💧 Water Pollution

🔋 Energy Usage

This helps users understand how harmful the waste is if disposed improperly.

4. Smart Disposal Guidance

EcoVision provides clear, actionable steps on:

How to recycle it

How to dispose of it safely

How to reduce environmental harm

5. PDF Report Generation

Users can generate a beautifully formatted PDF report containing:
